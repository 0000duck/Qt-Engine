# Qt-Engine

This is a simple scenes editor made of vector shapes, where you can create figures 
(circles, triangles...) and apply some modifications (change color, size...) on them.

## Authors:

## Features:
### 1) Hierarchy System
Through this window you can Add or Remove elements of the scene by clicking the respective buttons.

### 2) Inspector window
Every Game Object in the scene can be edited through this window. You can click in any element 
on the Hierarchy Window to see and edit its variables. We can observe 3 sub-sections:
- **Info:** the basic characteristics of the game object.
- **Transform:** to modify its position inside the scene.
- **Shape Render:** to edit its colors, size, form, and the outline.

### 3) Render scene
Central window where all the Game Objects are visualized.

### 4) Save/Load Project
- **Save (Ctr+S):** you can click the toolbar icon or go to "File->Save Project" to save the actual 
scene into a .json file.
- **Load (Ctr+O):** you can click the toolbar icon or go to "File->Open Project" to open a 
previously saved scene.
