This is a simple scenes editor made of vector shapes, where you can create figures 
(circles, triangles...) and apply some modifications (change color, size...) on them.

### 2) Inspector window
Every Game Object in the scene can be edited through this window. You can click in any element 
on the Hierarchy Window to see and edit its variables. We can observe 3 sub-sections:
- **Info:** the basic characteristics of the game object.
- **Transform:** to modify its position inside the scene.
- **Shape Render:** to edit its colors, size, form, and the outline.
