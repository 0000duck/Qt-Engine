# Qt-Engine
This is a 3D mini engine that lets you create GameObjects with different shapes (Cubes, Spheres, Planes...) and load models (.obj) to visualize them and modify their "visual appearance" with shading techinques.

  The user has 2 ways to add elements on the scene:

  **3. Drag & Drop:** he can also drag models (.obj) from anywhere to the engine. It will be automatically loaded on the scene and saved in the "Models" Folder.
